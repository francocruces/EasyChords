# Easy Lyrics Bot
This is an inline mode bot that retrieves chords from UG for the given query.

## How it works
This is an inline bot, that means that can be called from any chat by simply typing @EasyChordsBot.

After @EasyChordsBot you should write your chord search. An inline result will pop up showing the amount of results 
loaded. By selecting the article result, a message will be sent with an inline keyboard, where every button is a search 
result.

After selecting a button, the message will be edited so it no longer shows the inline keyboard and the text will be
the selected chords.
